          <h2>The Sesquicentennial of Treaty 1</h2>
          <p>
            "<span id="definition">The Sesquicentennial of Treaty 1</span> On
            August 3, 1871 the negotiations that became known as the “Stone
            Fort” treaty, or Treaty 1, were wrapped up at Lower Fort Garry,
            north of present-day Winnipeg. The treaty negotiations were a
            massive affair, even by today’s standards. More than a thousand Cree
            and Anishinaabe from southern Manitoba had begun to gather at the
            Hudson’s Bay Company post in July, and the subsequent negotiations
            took nine days to complete. Scores of colonial officials, settlers,
            missionaries, and journalists (including a newspaper delegation from
            the United States) were also present, many of whom wrote accounts of
            the proceedings. A contingent of soldiers accompanied the colonial
            delegation, in part to demonstrate the power of the “Dominion.” In
            the words of Lieutenant-Governor Adams Archibald, the ranking
            colonial figure involved: “Military display has always a great
            effect on savages, and the presence, even of a few troops, will have
            a good tendency.”[1] In the wake of the suppression of the Riel
            resistance in 1869-70, the threat of coercion was real. For most of
            post-Confederation history, Canadian historians and politicians have
            tended to view the written treaty document –– that was largely
            crafted in advance, slightly amended, and then signed on August 3rd
            –– as the first and last word on the meaning of the treaty. Most
            accounts dutifully followed the narrative framing established by
            Alexander Morris (one of the salient colonial negotiators of
            treaties 3 through 6) in his 1880 publication.[2] But even for those
            who have sought a deeper understanding of the spirit and intent of
            the treaty since the 1980s, and sought to incorporate Cree and
            Anishinaabe perspectives, as well as against-the-grain readings of
            colonial texts into their evaluation of the negotiations and the
            agreement, there has often been a privileging of the colonial
            presumption that Treaty 1 was, in the last instance, a “land
            cession” agreement in which First Nations gave up their claims to
            most of what is now southern Manitoba (an area of some 43,000 square
            kilometres).[3] The language used to describe Treaty 1 and the other
            “numbered treaties” of the 1870s has shifted significantly since the
            1980s, to emphasize First Nations participation, shrewd bargaining,
            and basic human agency, and also increasingly to frame the treaties
            as a complex agreement to share the land. These are welcome shifts
            given the overt colonial, white supremacist and nationalist
            narratives that had long dominated the historiography of
            “nation-building” and “settlement expansion” in prairie and Canadian
            historical works.[4] But in defaulting time and again to a “land
            surrender” paradigm rooted in colonial aims and texts, even
            well-meaning re-assessments of the treaty process have
            misrepresented the actual historical treaty negotiations, and
            implicitly or explicitly, lent themselves to false interpretations
            that First Nations gave up their sovereignty along with their lands,
            and became subjects of the British Empire and its Canadian
            “Dominion.” Even scholars and activists who share an anti-colonial
            lens and support First Nations treaty rights, struggles for
            self-determination, reparations for historical and ongoing human
            rights violations, contemporary efforts at land and water defence,
            as well as land reclamation, often fall into ways of framing
            questions of land and sovereignty that are based on colonial
            mythologies. For starters, the default acceptance of colonial and
            imperial claims to territory and unequivocal borders is itself
            anachronistic, extending contemporary State power backwards in time
            to historical moments when colonizers had little to no knowledge of
            the lands they claimed, let alone the peoples they claimed as
            “subjects”. To this day, historians are culpable in this project,
            insofar as they continue to justify colonization and theft by acting
            as if white people alone had fixed “borders,” whereas First Nations
            had “hunting grounds” –– a porous “frontier” beseeching outside
            exploration or “settlement,” rather than a land they had collective
            and national rights to exclude others from violating. To this day,
            historians write almost as if Europeans and their settler-states
            alone have borders worth recognizing as inviolable, and everyone
            else whose lands they covet merely has “frontiers.” But this is not
            a neutral descriptive distinction. It is a subtle justification and
            alibi for colonization, masquerading as description. Similarly, many
            well-meaning scholars and activists continue to adopt a commonplace
            shorthand for describing most of British Columbia as “unceded
            territory.” The aim of using “unceded” in this context is clear: to
            raise awareness about the fact that First Nations in B.C. have never
            surrendered their lands and sovereignty. But often unstated is an
            assumption that this is so simply because most of British Columbia
            is not covered by a treaty. Consciously or unconsciously, however,
            this way of demarcating between “unceded” territory in B.C., and
            ostensibly ceded territory everywhere else is ultimately rooted in a
            false colonial narrative that equates treaties as surrender
            agreements. British Columbia may very well be unceded territory, but
            this fact is not due to the absence of treaties per se, any more
            than the existence of treaties elsewhere is automatic evidence for
            land cession, let alone sovereignty cession. Rather than labelling
            it “unceded” (and implying that everything else from coast to coast
            is the opposite of that, i.e., “ceded”), a better description for
            large swaths of British Columbia is simply “land for which there are
            no treaties”. The following map accomplishes this well. It makes no
            assumptions about land or sovereignty cessions anywhere, and also
            demonstrates (through colour-coding) why Treaty 1 was not the first
            treaty inside the boundaries of present-day Canada, but was simply
            the first post-Confederation treaty.

          <p>
            In short, treaties are not homogeneous examples of “surrender”
            despite what we’re constantly told in settler-nationalist narratives
            about “land sales” between “consenting” parties. And more than this,
            even if a case can be made for a specific treaty to represent a land
            lease, sale, surrender, or agreement to share a specific tract of
            land –– this has no necessary implications whatsoever on broader
            questions of sovereignty and national self-determination for that
            specific treaty, let alone for every other one. The leap that
            Canadian historiography and popular narratives alike make from an
            ostensible “land sale” to a presumed-legitimate genealogy of
            colonial or State political jurisdiction, with its presumed
            concomitant loss of sovereignty for any and all indigenous peoples
            involved –– is not only an example of fallacious reasoning. It is
            colonial smoke-and-mirrors. Selling or sharing land is not a proxy
            for giving up one’s national and collective rights to
            self-determination, even within the geographical space in question.
            There are a number of reasons to be cautious about labeling treaties
            as land cessions, and thus, as the opposite of “unceded” –– which is
            ostensibly “lawfully surrendered.” First, the treaties are not
            homogenous. They cannot be lumped in together and talked about as if
            they’re all the same. They were made between different and distinct
            nations, at different historical moments, with different political,
            environmental, and material contexts at work in each case. And even
            beyond that broader context, each of these negotiating nations had
            heterogeneous leadership and membership within their communities,
            with differing political, spiritual, and ethical perspectives that
            they brought to the table. Canadian historians and politicians and
            settler society as a whole have a problematic tendency to homogenize
            diverse peoples as indigenous or as Aboriginal or as “Indian,” to
            presume homogeneous perspectives both within and across First
            Nations, and to generalize across treaties themselves in ways that
            are unwarranted. To give merely one example of this heterogeneity
            within a given community, during the Treaty 6 negotiations at Fort
            Carlton (north of present-day Saskatoon) in 1876, Cree Chief
            Mistawasis (“Big Child”) was one of the leaders, along with
            Ahtahkakoop (“Starblanket”), most favourable to signing the treaty.
            But Mistawasis’s own nephew Pitikwahanapiwiyin (mostly known as
            “Poundmaker”) had a very different political perspective. The idea
            that a foreign colonial power had some kind of audacity to tell the
            Cree of Saskatchewan how much land they would be “given,” and where
            they could have these so-called “reserves,” was preposterous to
            Poundmaker. He responded to Alexander Morris in a very powerful and
            pointed speech: “The Government mentions how much land is to be
            given to us. He says 640 acres, one mile square for each band, he
            will give us … This is our land. It isn’t a piece of pemmican to be
            cut off and given in little pieces back to us. It is ours and we
            will take what we want.”[5] Unsurprisingly, Poundmaker’s clear
            expression of Cree land ownership and self-determination never made
            it into Morris’s own account of the treaty negotiations. The only
            reason we know what he said is because the Cree hired their own
            interpreter for the treaty negotiations –– over the apparent
            objections of the colonial side –– and this interpreter later
            published his own account.[6] A second reason to be cautious is the
            fact that the written texts –– which do actually use legalistic
            phrases that imply massive swaths of territory were “ceded, yielded,
            surrendered” –– cannot possibly be understood as the sole and
            legitimate interpretation of the spirit of those treaties. Anyone
            who has actually studied them knows that the written texts were so
            different from the verbal negotiations, expectations, and promises
            made by and for the negotiating parties, that the textual
            alterations would themselves be considered a crime under contract
            law (both by yesterday’s standards and by today’s). Treaty 1 itself
            was emblematic of this divergence, because First Nations immediately
            objected to the non-fulfillment of both verbal and textual promises
            made at Lower Fort Garry, forcing Dominion negotiators to amend
            their own treaty text with what came to be called the “outside
            promises” in 1875.
